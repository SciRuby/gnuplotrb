== iRuby notebooks

This notebooks are powered by {Ruby kernel}[https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby/] for {IPython/Jupyter}[https://jupyter.org/].
I placed them here to show some gnuplot gem's capabilities and ways of using it together with iRuby.

=== Installation
To use gnuplot gem with iRuby you need to install them both.

* iRuby installation is covered in its {README}[https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby/blob/master/README.md].
  It also covers installation of iPython and other dependecies.
* Gnuplot gem installation covered in {README}[https://github.com/dilcom/pilot-gnuplot#installation] too.

=== Usage

Now you can use gnuplot gem to plot graphs to files and just open them with File::open to make iRuby render them. Example:
  plot = Plot.new('sin(x)')
  plot.to_svg('plot.svg')
  File.open('plot.svg')

==== Advanced (not recommended)
More natural way is to allow iRuby render Plot\Splot objects itself:
  plot = Plot.new('sin(x)')
  plot
To do so iRuby {display module}[https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby/blob/master/lib/iruby/display.rb] should be updated a little.
Since this update brokes old gnuplot gem support, I don't recommend using it now.
I will implement gnuplot support in iRuby this or better way when the gem is mature.

Instead of
  type { Gnuplot::Plot }
  format 'image/svg+xml' do |obj|
    Tempfile.open('plot') do |f|
      terminal = obj['terminal'].to_s.split(' ')
      terminal[0] = 'svg'
      terminal << 'enhanced' unless terminal.include?('noenhanced')
      obj.terminal terminal.join(' ')
      obj.output f.path
      Gnuplot.open do |io|
        io << obj.to_gplot
        io << obj.store_datasets
      end
      File.read(f.path)
    end
  end
In {display.rb}[https://github.com/SciRuby/iruby/blob/master/lib/iruby/display.rb] should be
  type { Gnuplot::Plottable }
  format 'image/svg+xml' do |obj|
    options = obj.term ? obj.term[1] : {}
    obj.to_svg(options)
  end
