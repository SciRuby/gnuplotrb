title: GnuplotRB gem at midterm of GSOC 2015
---
### Introduction

Hi, half of the GSOC 2015 is over so I think it's good time to draw a line under the work that is already done.
My project is visualization library (GnuplotRB) for Ruby based on Gnuplot.
In this post I'm going to write a few words about already implemented features and give several examples (mostly as links).

Gem installation is covered in its README.

### Features
#### 2D and 3D plots
#### Multiplot
#### Embedding into iRuby notebooks
#### Default sources of data
#### Notebook examples

### Discuss?

### Build & test
