title: GnuplotRB - GSoC 2015 project
---
### Introduction

Hi, I'm Ivan Evgrafov and this summer I've been participating in [Google Summer of Code]()
 with [GnuplotRB project]() (plotting tool for Ruby users based on [Gnuplot]())
 for [SciRuby](). GSoC is almost over and I'm releasing v0.3.1 of GnuplotRB as a [gem]().
 In this blog post I want to introduce the gem and highlight its capabilities.

### Features

There are several existing plotting tools for Ruby such as Nyaplot, Plotrb, Rubyvis
 and Gnuplot gem. Althought they are not designed for large datasets and have less
 plotting than Gnuplot. Gnuplot gem is developed far ago and nowadays consist
 mostly of hacks and does not support modern Gnuplot features such as multiplot.

Therefore my goal was to develop new gem for Gnuplot which would allow to use its
 features in Ruby. I was inspired to build easy-to-use interface for most common
 used features of Gnuplot and allow users to customize their plots with
 Gnuplot options as easy as possible.

#### 2D and 3D plots

#### Multiplot

#### Animated plots

#### Fit

#### Embedding plots into iRuby notebooks

#### Possible datasources for plots
