title: GnuplotRB gem at midterm of GSOC 2015
---
### Introduction

Hi, half of the GSOC 2015 is over so I think it's good time to draw a line under the work that is already done.
My project is visualization library (GnuplotRB) for Ruby based on Gnuplot.
In this post I'm going to write a few words about already implemented features and give several examples (mostly as links).

[Gem repository](https://github.com/dilcom/gnuplotrb) (with README and installation notes).

[Gem on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/gnuplotrb).

[Documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/gnuplotrb/).

### Features

#### Embedding plots into iRuby notebooks
GnuplotRB plots may be embedded into iRuby notebooks as images (terminals *svg, png, jpeg* and *pngcairo* are supported) or plain text (*dumb* terminal).
They may be customized with canvas size, font family, font size etc.
By default plots are embedded as *svg* and to change it one should use *term* option. Examples of embedding plots of different times may be found in [a notebook](https://github.com/dilcom/gnuplotrb/blob/v0.2.0/notebooks/basic_usage.ipynb).

#### 2D and 3D plots
GnuplotRB is capable to plot vast range of plots from histograms to 3D heatmaps. Gem's repository contains examples of several plot types:

* [heatmaps](https://github.com/dilcom/gnuplotrb/blob/v0.2.0/notebooks/heatmaps.ipynb)
* [vector field](https://github.com/dilcom/gnuplotrb/blob/v0.2.0/notebooks/vector_field.ipynb) (Thanks, Alexej)
* [math equations](https://github.com/dilcom/gnuplotrb/blob/v0.2.0/notebooks/math_plots.ipynb)
* [3D visualizations](https://github.com/dilcom/gnuplotrb/blob/v0.2.0/notebooks/3d_plot.ipynb)
* [histogram](https://github.com/dilcom/gnuplotrb/blob/v0.2.0/notebooks/histogram.ipynb)

Others may be found in [Gnuplot's examples](http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/demo/).

#### Possible datasources
GnuplotRB may take data in Ruby container or in a file. Supported containers for now are Arrays, Daru::Vector and Daru::DataFrame.
When data given in file, GnuplotRB pass filename to Gnuplot *without* reading the file into memory.

Examples of using different datasources:

* [data given in file or Ruby Array](https://github.com/dilcom/gnuplotrb/blob/v0.2.0/notebooks/points_from_different_sources.ipynb)
* [data given in Daru containers](https://github.com/dilcom/gnuplotrb/blob/v0.2.0/notebooks/plotting_from_daru.ipynb)

#### Multiplot
You can not only plot several datasets in single coordinate system but place several coordinate systems on a canvas.
[Example notebook](https://github.com/dilcom/gnuplotrb/blob/v0.2.0/notebooks/multiplot_layout.ipynb).

### Discuss?
You're very welcome to request examples or help and report bugs at [issues list](https://github.com/dilcom/gnuplotrb/issues).
There are also questions that should be discussed:

* [How to handle errors of Gnuplot in gem](https://github.com/dilcom/gnuplotrb/issues/3)
* [How to handle multi word options](https://github.com/dilcom/gnuplotrb/issues/7)
